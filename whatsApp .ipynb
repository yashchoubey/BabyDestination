Such children also score better at school by the age of nine, when compared to children who grow up in relatively quiet surroundings. ', ' ', \"The finding was published in the book 'Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children', by Betty Hart and Todd Risley. \", ' ', \"Typically, a baby's first words are something that every mom remembers fondly. But, how early is too early to begin to talk to your young one? Did you know that there are child prodigies who can speak three worded sentences by the age of eight months? And, incredibly, it's pretty much within your limits to help your baby cultivate language skills. Here' how you can achieve it: \", ' ', '1. Start Talking Very Early: ', \"When your baby is still at the babbling stage, you don't need to wait for him to lap up words and begin to talk. You should talk to your baby right from the start - perhaps right from birth. That way, the baby not only recognizes you, forms a deep bond with you, but also picks up the language fairly earlier than other babies. Early talking also helps babies to develop a large vocabulary. Early talking helps your baby familiarize himself with the words. And, with regular usage, your baby can gather the meaning of the word. \", ' ', 'Eventually, your baby could make a registry of the words in his brains. The more your baby hears the words, the more he would gain coherence. In yet another study, it turned out that preterm babies who were in the neonatal intensive care unit and exposed to a decent number of words, responded with sounds of their own, indicating that conversing with a premature baby could help developing his speech. ', ' ', 'Sponsored ', '2. Help With Connecting The Words: ', 'If your baby has had a long day with his routine of feeding, soothing, and changing, and you think he must sleep, tell him, \"It\\'s time for a nap, honey.\" If you watch your baby looking at a certain thing, tell him what that thing is and what it does, whether it is an eatable or a utility item, or if it is an animate creature like a bird or a pet. Keep telling him about everything you do with him - right from making food to setting his crib to organizing his toys. Or simply chant rhythmic nursery rhymes. ', ' ', '3. Read A Story: ', \"Even if your baby doesn't understand a story yet, it's quite an interesting way for him to learn words. If you are reading children's books, they are more likely to be colorful and bright. Show your baby the images to stimulate his imagination. You could explain the pictures as you go along. There are 'touch-and-feel' books available for babies under six months that could be quite useful and help them explore for themselves. \", ' ', '4. Encourage Dialogue: ', \"True, your baby might be too small to start talking in a meaningful way. But if your baby is already cooing at a thing, respond back. It will make your baby feel that you care for what he has to say. It could be quite encouraging. Also, he points to a cat or dog, tell him what it is, and what it is doing. If he utters meaningless sounds and you don't know what he is trying to say, you might as well respond in positive ways by making up a story. Or simply say something out of the box. \", ' ', '5. Put Your Baby Away From TV And Internet: ', \"There are loads of baby-centric programs on TV. A major chunk is also accessible on the Internet. Given that your baby has easy access to your laptop, tablet or smartphone, it's necessary that you keep him away from these. It might be easy to think that you can get away with your work while hooking your little one on these programs, but the reality is that such programs rarely do any good. Think; an animation does not talk back to your baby. A character from TV doesn't smile back either. And these reactions are important to raise your baby's stimulus to get him started with talking or learning a language.  Two-way communication is important to help baby learn to talk faster. \", ' ', ' ', ' Copy paste from fb ', '  ', '  ', ' Try give mixed proportion of grains health mix powder ', ' Dear Admin, Please add my friend to this group .

There might be relatives and friends taunting if you are not giving proper food to your baby because they resemble the malnourished ones of the other world. Just relax and maintain your cool, because chubby babies are more likely to be obese and slower in their motor skill development as compared to thin babies. \", ' ', 'Studies point out that children who are heavier than their peers at 24 months are likely to become obese when they reach adolescence. You are the lucky mother of a healthy baby if you do not have to rush to the doctor often, if your baby has completed all milestones and if your baby is pleasant and happy. Let your baby remain thin! Thin is healthy. ', ' ', 'Check The Activities: ', 'There are lots of activities the kids normally engage in. More activities mean more calories to be burnt naturally resulting in a thin baby but a healthy one. ', ' ', \"Stop being paranoid about all the excessive activities and constant running around that your baby engages in. It is only through active learning that kids grow up. Their fine motor skills and gross motor skills have to be developed. If a child is very active and continuously runs from this corner to that, be it at home or in the garden, it is very likely that he/she hardly gets time to complete the meal. Their 'play time' preoccupies their mind. Such babies have frequent meals because they feel hungry often. But each meal is left incomplete which is the reason why they have to rush for frequent meals. You may sit with your baby and ask him/ her to complete the meal. This way, the digestion process would also be maintained because we need to give the gut some rest! \", ' ', 'Sponsored ', 'Premature Babies Likely To Be More Obese: ', 'According to the Journal of Neuro Science Research, experiments were conducted on rats as rats have a great similarity to human babies. Initially, the food given to rats was controlled so that they produced pre-term babies, which are lower in weight than their peers. The rodent babies thus born were put under observation and it was found that they eat more because the neuropeptides disrupted in function. ', ' ', 'Neuropeptides are protein-like molecules, which help the signaling activity in the brain. The disrupted function of the neuropeptides in pre-term rats resulted in the intake of larger calories with less amount of energy expenditure. The same case applies to human babies as well. So, if your baby is premature, always check with a pediatrician on how to balance the diet. That is, do not be happy when your baby suddenly starts fattening up and gets the chubby guise that you have always dreamt of. ', \"Don't Feed Your Baby To Being Unhealthy: \", 'A popular study suggests that in an experiment conducted with rats, it was found that those rats whose diet was controlled and systematic became healthy as they grew up rather than those rats that were fed excessively. The rats that were fed excessively were diagnosed with higher levels of cholesterol and became obese as adults. ', ' ', 'Try not to over-feed your babies if you find them thin and do not load them with high-protein, high-fat diet that they might find very difficult to digest. Avoid sugary cereals and all those junk foods that promote the concept of a healthy obese baby. Remember chubby is not always healthy!
