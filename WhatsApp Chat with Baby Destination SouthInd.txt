08/02/18, 7:10 PM - Moms Event Sonakshi: Hi Mommies,
After a newborn baby arrives, you might have some questions related to umbilical stump like:
Is that normal?
How is it supposed to look?
How do I know my baby is not in pain because of it?
When will it heal and subside?
How do I care for it?
One of the most noticeable things about a newborn baby is its umbilical stump and it leaves many a first-time parent completely stumped!
So, let's discuss how to take care and what not to do while caring for the umbilical stump.

Mundan is an important Hindu Religion ceremony for babies and holds a traditional significance across many Indian cultures. It involves shaving off the baby’s head to completely remove all birth hair. It is done primarily in the first or the third year of a child’s life.
Buddhism, Jainism, Islam and Roman Catholics also have adopted different forms of tonsuring for varied reasons across different life stages.
Here are some benefits, myths and tips related to Mundan which are worth sharing.                                                               http://bit.ly/2H1WwaT_Is_Mundan_Helpful_in_hair_growth_in_babies

Periods. Do you feel shy to talk about this openly?
Well, recently Superstar Akshay Kumar Released a movie, Padman which talk about the Muruganantham’s love for his wife who not only helped his wife by making affordable sanitary pads but also made it accessible by selling it to only women self-help groups and other enterprising women.

Periods are natural for women. It is high time that we accept menstruation as a natural process and not as a taboo. It is the process that leads to the creation of life and continuity of the human species.

Thanks to Muruganantham for making the low-cost model to manufacture sanitary napkins and also to Akshay Kumar for making a great movie on this so that a larger audience will see and appreciate Murugan work. http://bit.ly/2sinTu2_Padman_movie_gives_a_great_message_to_women_about_Sanitary_Pads

To look smart and have an attractive appeal is always at the top of your mind, isn’t it? But sometimes, you can be let down by these little concerns in your own body that may prevent you from wearing the outfits of your choice or feel confident about yourself.

One of such issues is the presence of stretch marks. Have you ever wondered how these stretch marks are formed and what causes them? And are there ways to reduce their appearance or visibility?

To understand better, let us find out more about stretch marks.

What Are Stretch Marks?
Stretch marks look like bands of elongated scars or streaks on the surface of your skin, where it has been pulled too suddenly and quickly, thus disrupting the elasticity of the skin.
You could mostly find them at places where there are fatty tissues like on your arms, breasts, stomach, buttocks, and thighs. It’s not a disease and it is said that as many as 80% people get it in their lifetime. It affects both men and women.

Reasons You Could Get Stretch Marks
￼Sponsored
There are many reasons why you could get stretch marks and they include:

Puberty and body changes.
Hormonal changes.
Sudden increase in weight.
Pregnancy.
Is It Possible To Remove Stretch Marks?

Once you get stretch marks on your skin, it might be difficult to remove them completely. There are oils, creams, and cosmetic interventions, but it might be time-consuming, expensive, and even ineffective. What works for one kind of skin, doesn’t necessarily work for other types, and may end up irritating your skin further.

However, in case you are wondering if there is any home remedy or quick trick that can lighten or diminish your stretch marks, you are in the right spot! One trick that claims to clear away any persistent stretch marks is the use of Vicks VapoRub.

Yes, you read it right. Many people have found this humble jar of cough and cold remedy to be an effective stretch mark remedy as well. So, what makes Vicks an effective skin-balm?

Vicks VapoRub Ingredients
Among other things, Vicks contain some essential oils like eucalyptus oil, turpentine oil and cedar leaf oil that moisturise and nourish the skin. Plus, the base of petrolatum also acts as an emollient. Camphor is another soothing ingredient. All in all, these elements in the VapoRub give enough nourishment to the skin so that the dry, stretched-out skin looks and feels softer. Thus, the skin appears smoothened out as well.

How To Apply Vicks To The Stretch Marks?
It is easy to apply Vicks VapoRub on your stretch marks. Simply follow the steps below:

Rub Vicks generously over the area that has stretch marks.
Wrap cling film firmly around it, ensuring that the balm seeps deep into the skin.
If possible, leave it overnight or for the maximum time you can manage.
After you remove the film, do not forget to rub some aloe vera gel liberally for further healing and for stimulating the growth of new skin cells.
Do follow this process every single day for at least one month to find a noticeable difference in the appearance and visibility of the marks.
The makers of Vicks VapoRub have not claimed any benefits of topical application of the balm as far as stretch marks are concerned, but the beneficiaries of this procedure beg to differ. Many people have found this trick very helpful in reducing their embarrassing stretch marks. So, if you think it’s going to help you, there is no harm in giving it a try!

What are the reasons for postpartum back pain?
How long does postpartum back pain last?
How to get relief from back pain post delivery?
When to call a doctor?
Frequently asked questions
It is there throughout your pregnancy, during your delivery, and even after that. If you thought that you could get freedom from back pain after delivery, then you’d be disappointed to know that it is likely to last beyond that point.

Momjunction helps you understand the reasons for back pain after delivery, and ways to deal with it.

What Are The Reasons For Postpartum Back Pain?
Postpartum back pain can be a result of various physical changes that your body undergoes during pregnancy and the tremendous physical stress during delivery.

Here are the reasons for backache post delivery:

Sponsored
The body releases progesterone and relaxin hormones during pregnancy to loosen the ligaments and joints of the pelvic bone to help the baby come out with ease (1). The weak ligaments and muscles lead to back pain. These hormones stay raised for a few months post delivery.
Having a wrong posture, especially while breastfeeding, can strain the muscles, causing backache.
As the uterus expands during pregnancy, it weakens the abdominal muscles and pulls the lower spine forward, putting pressure on the lower back muscles.
Being overweight puts extra pressure on your back.
The delivery process stresses the lower back, and it takes time to recover.
Bending frequently for lifting your baby or for something else results in back pain.
If you had back pain before and during pregnancy, it is likely to continue postpartum as well.
Physically taxing work might also lead to back pain.
[ Read: Postpartum Fatigue ]

It is not encouraging to know that your pregnancy pains will persist even after your delivery. But you might find solace in knowing the time-frame for them to subside.

Back to top


How Long Does Postpartum Back Pain Last?
Typically, the back pain subsides within six months after delivery. By then, the level of relaxin hormone settles down and the body gets back to normal.

As the muscles get toned, joints are tightened and your body regains strength, the back pain wanes. However, in some cases, the pain persists for about 12 months owing to heavy physical activities by the new mother (2).

But, it doesn’t mean that you have to reel under the pain for so long. You may take some measures to get relief.

12/02/18, 12:41 PM - ‪+91 99460 02674‬: 17 Ways To Get Relief From Back Pain Post Delivery
Back pain after childbirth ranges from mild to severe, and it differs from person to person. The pain will subside gradually as your body gets back to normal. Meanwhile, you may use these simple tips to relieve the back pain post-pregnancy:

 

Make efforts to get back to your normal weight after a month or so post delivery. Take the right diet to maintain an ideal weight.
[ Read: Post Pregnancy Diet ]

Start exercising or do yoga after childbirth as it helps in improving the health of the strained muscles and ligaments (3). Also, it helps increase the flexibility and endurance. Walking is a safe exercise to start with if you have had a C-section. Later, you can opt for swimming as it helps in strengthening your muscles.
You may also do some pelvic tilts. Here is how you can do them:
Lie on your back. Bend the knees and keep your feet flat on the floor.
Breathe in and let your belly expand.
Breathe out keeping your hips on the floor and bring your tailbone towards the belly button. Tighten your buttocks and release.
Repeat it 8-10 times.
Note: If you have had a C-section, then wait for at least six weeks before you start with this exercise.

Take rest as much as possible as strenuous physical activities will aggravate your pain.
Do not lift heavy things after delivery as it can put pressure on your muscles and joints.
Maintain a proper posture while sitting. Avoid leaning towards your baby while breastfeeding and instead sit with an upright back. If you have pain in your shoulder or upper back while breastfeeding, then lie on your side to feed your baby comfortably.
Choose a comfortable chair for sitting, with a lot of pillows to support your back. Also, use a footstool to keep your feet slightly raised from the floor, to mitigate the lower back pain.
Avoid wearing high-heel footwear for a few months after delivery.
Avoid carrying the baby on one hip for a longer time because it puts constant pressure on the back muscles. Use a front pack to carry your baby.
Avoid stretching your arms while picking your baby. Instead, get closer to your baby and then lift.
Sleep in a comfortable position and use pillows for support.
While placing your child in the back seat of the car do not bend or stretch your arms. Instead, kneel down on the back seat and place your baby in the car seat.
To pick up anything from the floor, bend at your knees rather than bending at the waist, to minimize the strain on your back.
Have warm water baths as they help in relaxing strained muscles and muscle pains. Avoid bathing in cold water soon after delivery as it can strain your muscles.
Get an oil massage done from a professional masseur once in a while. It helps improve blood circulation and offers great relief.
Use a hot water bag or a cold pack to alleviate the pain.
For mild to moderate back pain, a pain relief ointment works well. Gently apply it on the area to get instant relief.
Practicing relaxation techniques like progressive muscle relaxation therapy (4) and breathing exercises help ease the discomfort of back pain.
If the pain does not subside with the above steps, then visit your doctor. They may prescribe you medication for short-term relief.

When To Call A Doctor?
Usually, the back pain resolves itself after a few month post delivery. But, you must call a doctor if:

The pain is severe and gets worse gradually
It is accompanied by a fever
Pain is caused by trauma such as a fall
There is numbness in one or both the legs
You suddenly feel uncoordinated
If the back pain persists even after six months
It might not be easy to live with the pain when you already have a lot to take care of. Your newborn and their well-being will be top most priority to you, but you need to take time to focus on yourself and your health.

While we have extensively covered about the measures you can take to get relief, you might have a few more questions on back pain after delivery. So, here we answer them.

DEADLY POISONOUS COCKTAIL
for your child .. 
while the company may ridicule by saying its a 150 year old proven safe formula ..but if we peep in carefully in to the history .. gripe water itself is a SCAM and rejected by its originating country USA because it used ALCOHOL which was banned for child consumption ..
so now 10-15 years back the alcohol in woodwards gripe water is replaced by more DEADLY CHEMICAL PRESERVATIVES lets analyze them .

1) BRONOPOL .. it is the most deadly bromine containing chemical used in woodwords gripe water ..
BRONOPOL is never used in edible food anywhere in the world ..
only used in cosmetics and external medication.. it is disinfectant and antimicrobial 
for example  dettol and povidine iodine are NEVER used in food because of their known toxicity if taken internally  ..similary bronopol  cannot be consumed or added to food ..
but thanks to the GOVERNMENT OF INDIA  it has given permission to add bronopol to child medicine !! 

Are indian children used as GUINEA PIGS to see the effect of bronopol in food ??

Bronopol acts by releasing FORMALDEHYDE which is a notorious CARCINOGEN !!(cancer causing substance) 

Bromine present in bronopol acts as  ANTIANDROGEN  ..it destroys the testosterone stem cells of male children making them sterile gay transgender after they grow up ..

2) methyl paraben , ethyl propyl parabens..
these chemicals are known for carcinogenesis and human endocrine disruptors and also proven to decrease the male sperm count and motility!! 

3) sodium benzoate  .. same toxic effects as parabens.. 

i can see evil intention in adding triple doses of benzoic acid...to gripe water 
( 1 methyl parabenzoic acid 2) propyl parabenzoic acid 3 sodium benzoate  ) ..as paraben is a short form for parabenzoic acid!!
and they never mention the exact amount of chemical preservatives added 
all the chemicals have common poisonous effect.. decreasing male fertility in children  and cancer 
the world elite super rich people have a hidden agenda ..to decrease the world population.. various nefarious methods are used to achieve their goals .. 
they poison the most commonly used food substance ..for example drinking water is poisoned by chlorine in india and other third world countries. .and fluoride is added to drinking water in america and European countries .. bromine is added to mineral water kinley aquafina etc
natural sea salt is poisoned with iodine ..! and now after seeing the ingrediants of gripe water it is clear that even the children are not spared
for more detailed description ..

கர்பமாக இருக்கும் சில பெண்களுக்கு டாக்டர் சொல்லும் டெலிவரி டேட் வந்தாலும் வலி வராது அதற்கு ஒரு கஞ்சி இருக்கு அதை காய்ச்சி கொடுத்தால் வலி வரும் அந்த கஞ்சி குடிக்கும் போது வெண்ணீர் வைத்து குளித்து விட்டுதான் குடிக்க வேண்டும்

கஞ்சிக்கு தேவையான பொருள்கள்
அரிசி-1கப்
முருங்கை கீரை-1/4கப்
வெந்தயம்-3ஸ்பூன்
தேங்காய் பால்-1கப்
உப்பு-தேவையான அளவு

செய்முறை
1.ஒரு பாத்திரத்தில் தண்ணீர் ஊற்றி சூடாக்கவும்.
2.அரிசியை தண்ணீர் விட்டு கழுவவும்.
3.சூடாக்கிய தண்ணீரில் அரிசி,வெந்தயம்,உப்பு போட்டு கொதிக்க விடவும்.
4.எல்லாம் நன்றாக வெந்தவுடன் கீரை,பால் இரண்டையும் போடவும்.
5.எல்லாவற்றையும் சேர்த்து 10 நிமிடம் கொதிக்கவிடவும்.
6.அவ்வளவுதான் ரெடியாகி விடும் கஞ்சி.

பின் குறிப்பு
இந்த கஞ்சி இரண்டு நாள் குடித்தாள் போதும் வலி வந்து விடும் ஆனால் வெண்ணீர் வைத்து குளித்து விட்டுதான் குடிக்க வேண்டும் சும்மா குடித்தால் ஒரு உபயோகமும் இல்லை.இந்த கஞ்சி நிஷாவுக்கு காய்ச்சி தந்தார்கள் நிஷாவுக்கு உடனே வலி வந்தது. அனைவரும் தெரிந்து பயன் அடையவே நான் இந்த குறிப்பை போட்டேன்.

We have always heard “Prevention is better than Cure”, but it is essential when it comes to diseases and babies. No matter how strong a baby’s immune system is, there are various diseases which the immune system is not equipped enough to prevent.
Hence, it is important to get your child vaccinated as it will avert those diseases and ensure that the child remains hearty and healthy.
So, here are some important vaccines that Pediatricians recommend and you must ensure your child gets suggested vaccinations on time. http://bit.ly/2CebQNW_Essential_Vaccination_Chart_for_Babies

12/02/18, 11:41 PM - ‪+91 83104 17090‬: Woodwords gripe water ...
DEADLY POISONOUS COCKTAIL
for your child .. 
while the company may ridicule by saying its a 150 year old proven safe formula ..but if we peep in carefully in to the history .. gripe water itself is a SCAM and rejected by its originating country USA because it used ALCOHOL which was banned for child consumption ..
so now 10-15 years back the alcohol in woodwards gripe water is replaced by more DEADLY CHEMICAL PRESERVATIVES lets analyze them .

1) BRONOPOL .. it is the most deadly bromine containing chemical used in woodwords gripe water ..
BRONOPOL is never used in edible food anywhere in the world ..
only used in cosmetics and external medication.. it is disinfectant and antimicrobial 
for example  dettol and povidine iodine are NEVER used in food because of their known toxicity if taken internally  ..similary bronopol  cannot be consumed or added to food ..
but thanks to the GOVERNMENT OF INDIA  it has given permission to add bronopol to child medicine !! 

Are indian children used as GUINEA PIGS to see the effect of bronopol in food ??

Bronopol acts by releasing FORMALDEHYDE which is a notorious CARCINOGEN !!(cancer causing substance) 

Bromine present in bronopol acts as  ANTIANDROGEN  ..it destroys the testosterone stem cells of male children making them sterile gay transgender after they grow up ..

2) methyl paraben , ethyl propyl parabens..
these chemicals are known for carcinogenesis and human endocrine disruptors and also proven to decrease the male sperm count and motility!! 

3) sodium benzoate  .. same toxic effects as parabens.. 

i can see evil intention in adding triple doses of benzoic acid...to gripe water 
( 1 methyl parabenzoic acid 2) propyl parabenzoic acid 3 sodium benzoate  ) ..as paraben is a short form for parabenzoic acid!!
and they never mention the exact amount of chemical preservatives added 
all the chemicals have common poisonous effect.. decreasing male fertility in children  and cancer 
the world elite super rich people have a hidden agenda ..to decrease the world population.. various nefarious methods are used to achieve their goals .. 
they poison the most commonly used food substance ..for example drinking water is poisoned by chlorine in india and other third world countries. .and fluoride is added to drinking water in america and European countries .. bromine is added to mineral water kinley aquafina etc
natural sea salt is poisoned with iodine ..! and now after seeing the ingrediants of gripe water it is clear that even the children are not spared
for more detailed description ..

13/02/18, 6:13 PM - Moms Event Sonakshi: Hi Mommies,
Breast milk is the only source of nutrition for babies 👶 for the first six months. It is very soothing and calming for your baby and may lead her fall asleep during the process.
It is necessary to wake up babies less than two weeks old in every two hours to feed them and prevent dehydration. This ensures that the baby is getting enough nutrition for the rapid growth and development.
If your baby is unable to stay awake during breastfeeding, here are some tips and tricks that you may try to keep her from dozing off.

15/02/18, 6:47 PM - Moms Event Sonakshi: Hi Mommies,
Is it really good to let the baby cry for long? 😏
Does it really help in the development of the baby’s lungs? 🤔

Crying 😭 is a baby’s way of communicating its need. Your baby might be hungry, wet or just wants to be with you or it might just want to cry without any reason.

Allowing babies to cry does no good to them either physically or emotionally. Here is the complete guide for your baby's cry...😮http://bit.ly/2CmZV0zBiggest_Myth_Crying_strengthens_your_baby_lungs

16/02/18, 6:34 PM - Moms Event Sonakshi: Hi Mommies,
Finally, you have tested positive in the pregnancy test 😮 And now, your next concern will be to know the date of arrival of your baby 🤔

But on which day will your bundle of joy arrive? 👶 This is the question ❓ that would keep you guessing and that would be frequently asked by your friends and family.

Dear Mothers, the due date is always “estimated” and not accurately calculated to a final value. Here are the best ways to calculate due date...🗓

17/02/18, 3:07 PM - ‪+91 99460 02674‬: DIY Chamomile & Lavender Homemade Baby Powder

(makes about ¼ cup – recipe can be doubled or tripled for larger amounts)

Ingredients

2 tablespoons white kaolin clay (find it here)
2 tablespoons arrowroot powder (find it here)
3 drops chamomile (Roman or German) essential oil (find 100% pure Roman chamomile EO here or German chamomile here)
3 drops lavender essential oil (find 100% pure lavender EO here)
Directions

In a small bowl, combine dry ingredients and stir carefully.
Drip essential oils on top and stir thoroughly to combine.
Transfer to a powder shaker bottle like this or this, or a re-purposed spice bottle with shaker top.
To Use

Always shake a small amount into your hand before applying to baby. Shaking directly onto baby’s skin could cause baby to inhale the powder, which will be irritating to his/her sensitive system.

Cautions

This recipe is not intended for babies under 3 months of age. (See recommendations above for very young babies.) Do not use on broken skin.

Variations and Other Additions

If you are making this body powder for an adult, you have a much larger range of ingredients you can use without worrying about irritation.

Clays – Experiment with other clays like bentonite, or whatever you have on hand. (Find other clays here.)

Dried calendula flowers – Calendula is a popular herb for skin care, known for its healing properties. Grind 1 tablespoon dried calendula flowers in a spice/coffee grinder, and sift out any large pieces before adding to your body powder. (Find organic dried calendula flowers here.)

Dried lavender flowers – Lavender is also a skin-soothing herb, and will also leave your powder smelling sweet. Grind 1 tablespoon dried lavender flowers in a spice/coffee grinder, sifting out large pieces before adding to body powder. (Find organic dried lavender flowers here.)

Other essential oils – If using this DIY body powder on adults, feel free to experiment with other essential oils that are appropriate for skin, like geranium, tea tree, lemongrass, sandalwood, or patchouli. You can also use more essential oils than what is called for in the above recipe. For adults, feel free to increase the oils to about 10-15 drops. As always, be sure you do not have a sensitivity to one of these oils before using

Today I have put second dose vaccination for my kid. He is having a slight fever of 99.1 degree Fahrenheit. Should i give him calpol or it will get reduced by itself ?
17/02/18, 6:55 PM - ‪+91 80891 46133‬: Tq
17/02/18, 7:05 PM - ‪+91 87541 18325‬: My baby too had the same problem till her 5th month.. This will reduce, When u start semi solids. Till then u have to make little changes for his comfort.
1. Before shifting from one breast to the other, burp him.
2. Do not lie him down soon after burping. Have him in a 45 degree angle so as his upper body is held high from his tummy.
Hold him in this position for least 20 min.
3. lie him down on his tummy or towards left side, so that if the milk comes out also he will not have discomfort.
4. Give colic aid drops when ever necessary.
5.make his bed in a slanding position at night times.
6.do not worry, simple changes would solve this problem.
17/02/18, 7:51 PM - ‪+91 90032 20477‬: Dnt worry

19/02/18, 11:54 AM - Moms Event Sonakshi: Hi Mommies,
The food 🥞🧀🍳 that you give to your baby must be nutrient rich and high in calories to facilitate ideal weight gain and proper development.

Eating issues 😤 may rise when you begin to introduce solid foods 🍞🧀 to your little one’s diet. This is when he will begin to change food preferences on a regular basis, often leading to a loss of appetite.

This can become a challenge for moms. It can be a serious issue as it can cause nutritional deficiencies in your child 😣

20/02/18, 7:21 PM - ‪+91 70920 07888‬: குழந்தைக்கு சிறுவயதிலேயே கற்றுக் கொடுக்க வேண்டியவைகள்....!!

1. பெண் குழந்தைகள் யாருடைய மடியிலும் அமரக்கூடாது என்று சொல்லிக் கொடுக்க வேண்டும்.

2. 2 அல்லது 3 வயதுக்கு மேல் ஆன குழந்தைகள் முன்னிலையில் உடை மாற்றிக் கொள்ளுவதைத் தவிர்க்க வேண்டும்.

3. குழந்தைகளுக்கு யாரும் இது உன்னுடைய கணவன் என்றோ, மனைவியென்றோ குறிப்பிடுவதோ, மனதில் பதிய வைப்பதோ தவறு.

4. குழந்தை விளையாடப் போகும்போது உங்கள் பார்வை அவர்கள் மீது இருந்து கொண்டே இருக்கட்டும்.
மேலும் அவர்கள் என்ன விளையாடுகிறார்கள் என்பதையும் கவனித்துக் கொள்ளுங்கள். ஏனென்றால்
குழந்தைகள் தங்களுக்குள்ளாக வே பாலியல்
துன்புறுத்தல்களுக்கு உள்ளாக நேரிடும்.

5. உங்கள் குழந்தையால் சரியாக பொருந்தியிருக்க முடியாத நபரை ஒருபோதும் சந்திக்க அனுமதிக்காதீர்கள்
அல்லது அவரிடம் அழைத்துச் செல்லாதீர்கள்.

6. சுறுசுறுப்பாக இருக்கக் கூடிய ஒரு குழந்தை திடீரென்று களையிழந்துவிடும் போது பொறுமையாக அவர்களிடம் பல கேள்விகளைக் கேட்டு அவர்களின் பிரச்சனை என்னவென்று கேட்டறிய வேண்டும்.

7. வளரும் பருவத்திலேயே உடலுறவு மற்றும் அதன் நன்மதிப்பீடுகளை பக்குவமாக கற்பியுங்கள்.
இல்லையென்றால், சமுதாயம் அவர்களுக்கு அதைப் பற்றிய தீய மதிப்பீடுகளைக் கற்றுக் கொடுத்துவிடும்.

8.குழந்தைகளுக்கு தேவையானவற்றை அவர்களுக்கு முன்பாக நாம் அறிந்து கொண்டு அவர்கள் கேட்பதற்கு முன்பாக நாமே வாங்கிக் கொடுத்துவிட வேண்டும்.

9. தொலைக்காட்சி சேனல்கள் மற்றும் இணையதளங்களில் குழந்தைகள் பார்க்க அவசியமற்ற
சேனல்களை பேரண்டல் கன்ட்ரோல் மூலம் செயலிழக்கச்
செய்துவிட்டோமா என்பதை உறுதிப்படுத்திக் கொள்வது நல்லது. மேலும், குழந்தைகள் அடிக்கடி செல்லும் நம் நண்பர்களின் வீடுகளிலும் இதை செய்து வைக்க அறிவுருத்துவது நல்லது.

10. 3 மூன்று வயது ஆனவுடனேயே குழந்தைகளுக்கு தங்கள் உடலின் அந்தரங்கப் பகுதிகளை சுத்தம் செய்ய
கற்றுக் கொடுக்க வேண்டும். உடலின் அந்தப் பகுதிகளை பிறர் யாரும் தொடுவதற்கு அனுமதிக்கக் கூடாது என
எச்சரிக்கை செய்து வைக்க வேண்டும்.
நீங்களும் அந்த வேலையை செய்யக் கூடாது.
ஏனென்றால், அவசியமற்ற உதவிகளை செய்யும் போக்கு வீட்டிலிருந்துதான் தொடங்குகிறது

11. குழந்தையை அச்சுறுத்தக் கூடிய அல்லது அவர்களின்
மனநிலையை பாதிக்கக் கூடியவற்றை முற்றாகத் தவிர்க்கவும். இதில் இசை, படங்கள், நண்பர்கள் மற்றும்
குடும்பங்களும் அடங்கும்.

12. மற்றவர்களுடன் ஒப்பிடும்போது உங்கள் குழந்தையின் தனித்துவத்துத்தை அல்லது தனித் திறமையைப் புரிந்து கொள்ளச் செய்யுங்கள்.

13. குழந்தை ஒருவரைப் பற்றி ஒருமுறை குற்றச்சாற்றைக்
கூறினாலே, அதை கவனிக்கத் தொடங்குங்கள்.
கேட்டுவிட்டு அமைதியாக இருக்க வேண்டாம். நீங்கள் அதற்காக நடவடிக்கை எடுத்தீர்கள் என்பதை குழந்தைக்கு உணரச் செய்யுங்கள்.

* மேலே சொன்னது யாவும் ஞாபகம் இருக்கட்டும்;
அது நாம் பெற்றோராக இருந்தாலும் சரி அல்லது பெற்றோராகப் போகிறவராக இருந்தாலும் சரி! "

அன்றைய காலகட்டத்தில் பெண் பிள்ளைகள் வயதிற்கு வந்து விட்டால் பாவாடை தாவணி கட்டுவதை வழக்கமாக கொண்டிருந்தனர்.பின்னர் சில வருடங்கள் கழித்து சேலை கட்டுவார்கள்.முன்னோர்கள் நமக்கு சொல்லிக்கொடுத்த அந்த பழக்கத்தை இப்போது நாம் கைவிட்டு விட்டோம்.

நமது முன்னோர்கள் ஏன் அப்படி சொன்னார்கள் தெரியுமா..?

Image result for தாவணி அணிந்த பெண்
பருவமடைந்ததில் இருந்து, கர்ப்பபை உள்ள இடத்திலும், தொப்பிளை சுற்றிலும் காற்றோட்டம் இருக்க வேண்டும் என்பதற்க்காகத் தான் பாவாடை தாவணி மற்றும் சேலை அணியும் பழக்கத்தை நம் முன்னோர்கள் ஏற்படுத்தினார்கள்.

அப்போது தான், அங்கு அதிக உஷ்ணம் ஏற்படாமல் இருந்து கர்ப்பபையை காக்கும் என்பதற்காகத்தான்.ஆனால், தற்போதைய காலகட்டத்தில், ஜீன்ஸ், டீ சர்ட், சுடிதார் என்று அணிந்து கொள்கிறார்கள். அதனால், கர்ப்பபை உஷ்ணம் அடைந்து, அந்த உஷ்ணம் வெளியேற வழியின்றி, உடலே கர்ப்பபையை காக்க நீர்கட்டியை கர்ப்பபையிக்குள் ஏற்படுத்தி உஷ்ணத்தை குறைக்க முயற்சி செய்கிறது.

தற்போது பெரும்பாலான பெண்களுக்கு கர்ப்ப பையில் நீர்க்கட்டி பிரச்சனை ஏற்படுகின்றது. அதனால், கரு உருவாகுவதில் தடை ஏற்படுகிறது. அதை சரி செய்ய மருத்துமனைக்கு சென்று பல ஆயிரங்கள் செலவு செய்கிறார்கள். அதற்கு காரணம், முன்னோர்கள் சொல்லி கொடுத்ததை நாம் மறந்து விட்டோம் என்பதே ஆகும்.

அதனோடு, அந்த காலத்தில் பெண்கள் வீட்டினை சாணம் இட்டு மொழுவுவார்கள். அது ஓர் சிறந்த உடற்பயிற்சி.வயிற்றினை அழுத்தி மண்டியிட்டு வேலைசெய்யும் பொழுது, நரம்புகளும், இடுப்பு எலும்புகளும் வலுப்படும்.

தாவணி அணிந்த பெண்
ஆனால், தற்போது அதற்கான தேவை இல்லாத போதும், வீடு பெருக்குவது, மாப் போட்டு துடைப்பது என்று அனைத்து வேலைகளையும் நின்று கொண்டே செய்கிறார்கள்.

சகோதரிகளே…!! தயவுசெய்து ஒன்றை மட்டும் நன்கு புரிந்து கொள்ளுங்கள்.
நீங்கள் நாகரீகம்… வளர்ச்சி… என்று எடுத்து வைக்கும் ஒவ்வொரு அடியின் போதும், ஆரோக்கியம் என்ற விசயத்தில், பத்து அடி பின்னோக்கி செல்கிறீர்கள்… என்பதனை மட்டும் மறவாதீர்கள் .நம்முடைய பாட்டி காலத்தில் நாம் கேள்விப்படாத புதுப் புதுப் பெயரில், தற்போது பெண்களுக்கு வரும் நோய்களை பற்றி கேள்விப்படுகிறோம்… இதற்கு காரணம் நம்முடைய புதிய வாழ்க்கை முறையே.

வேகமான வாழ்க்கைக்கு ஆசைப்பட்டு…, வேகாத உணவை…, வேகமாக உண்டு…, வேகமாக உடுத்தும் மோசமான உடைகளை உடுத்தி… வேகமாக உழைத்து…. வேகமாகவே மடிந்தும் விடுகிறோம்.

ഈ സഹോദരി പ്രസവത്തിനാണ് ഈ ഹോസ്പിറ്റലിൽ അഡ്മിറ്റ് ചെയ്തത്.
ഡോക്ടർ സുശീലയെ ആണ് കാണിച്ചത്.
ശനിയാഴ്ച സിസേറിയൻ വേണമെന്ന് പറഞ്ഞു.സിസേറിയനു ശേഷം കുഞ്ഞിനെ ഞങ്ങൾക്ക് തന്നു.

ഈ സഹോദരിയെ ലേബർ റൂമിന്റെ അടുത്തുള്ള റൂമിലേക്ക് മാറ്റുകയും ചെയ്തു.
അര മണിക്കൂറിനു ശേഷം കുട്ടിക്ക് പാല് കൊടുക്കാൻ വേണ്ടി കൊണ്ട് പോയപ്പോൾ ഈ സഹോദരി ചോരയിൽ കുളിച്ചു കിടക്കുന്നതാണ് കണ്ടത്.

നഴ്സുമാരോട് ചോദിച്ചപ്പോൾ കുഴപ്പമില്ല കുഴപ്പമില്ല എന്ന് അവർ  പറഞ്ഞു.
ശേഷം അവർ മെയിൻ ഡോക്ടറെ വിളിച്ചു വരുത്തി പിന്നീട് ഡോക്ടർമാരും നഴ്സുമാരും നെട്ടോട്ടം ഓടുന്നതാണ്  കണ്ടത്.
ഞങ്ങൾ പല തവണ കാര്യം തിരക്കിയെങ്കിലും കുഴപ്പം ഒന്നുമില്ല ഒന്നുമില്ല എന്നാണു അവർ പറഞ്ഞത്.
രാത്രി ഒരു 8.30 - 9 മണി ആയപ്പോൾ ഡോക്ടർ BP കുറഞ്ഞു എന്നും പറഞ്ഞു അവർ തന്നെ ആംബുലൻസിൽ ബേബി ഹോസ്പിറ്റലിലേക്ക് കൊണ്ടുപോവുകയും ചെയ്തു.

Cisseriyan സമയത്തു ഞരമ്പ് കട്ടായിപ്പോയതാണ്.

അത് മറച്ചു വെച്ചതാണ് ഇത്രയും വഷളാവാൻ കാരണം.

ഇതിനാൽ ഈ സഹോദരിയുടെ hart ബീറ്റ്സും പൾസും എല്ലാം ഡൗൺ ആയിപ്പോയിരുന്നു.


ഉടനെ വെണ്ടിലേറ്ററിലേക്ക് മാറ്റുകയും ചെയ്തു.



എന്നാൽ വൈകിപ്പോയിരുന്നു സുഹൃത്തുക്കളെ


ഈ സഹോദരി ഇന്ന് മരണമടയുകയും ചെയ്തു.


ഇതിനെതിരെ നമ്മുടെ ശബ്ദം ഉയരണം.......



നമുക്കൊന്നിച്ചു നിൽക്കാം


കാരണം ഈ ഗതി നാളെ മറ്റൊരു സഹോദരിക്കും വന്നു കൂടാ....


അതിനാൽ ഈ മെസ്സേജ് എല്ലാ ഗ്രൂപ്പിലേക്കും ഷെയർ ചെയ്യുക......


ലോകം അറിയട്ടെ ഈ ഹോസ്പിറ്റലിനെയും ഹോസ്പിറ്റൽ മാനേജ്മെന്റിനെയും കുറിച്ച്............

செய்முறை :

ராகி, சோளம், கம்பு, பாசிப்பயறு, கொள்ளு ஆகியவற்றை தண்ணீரில் 12 மணி நேரம் ஊற வைக்க வேண்டும்.
தண்ணீரை நன்றாக வடித்த பின்னர் அதை ஒரு துணியில் கட்டி 12 மணி நேரம் கழித்து எடுத்தால், தானியங்கள் முளை விட்டு இருக்கும். அவற்றை 3 நாள் வெயிலில் காய வைக்க வேண்டும். மற்ற பொருட்களை ஒரு நாள் வெயிலில் காய வைக்க வேண்டும். அனைத்தையும் மொத்தமாக மாவு மில்லில் அரைத்து, 4 மணி நேரம் ஆற வைத்தால் சத்து மாவு தயார். 12 கிலோ மாவு கிடைக்கும்.
சத்து மாவு தயாரிக்க தேவையான பொருட்கள் மளிகைக் கடைகளில் கிடைக்கின்றன. தனியாக இடம் எதுவும் தேவையில்லை. வீட்டிலேயே தானியங்களை ஊற வைத்து, முளை கட்டலாம். வீட்டு வளாகத்தில் காய வைக்கலாம். 

தானியங்களை இந்த அளவு வீட்டு மிக்சியில் அரைத்தால் சரியாக வராது. மாவு மில்லில் கொடுத்து அரைக்க வேண்டும்.

பயன்கள் 

1.ஒரு நபருக்கு ஒரு டம்ளர் தண்ணீர் வீதம் கொதிக்க வைக்க வேண்டும்.

2. ஒருவருக்கு 2 ஸ்பூன் மாவு வீதம் தண்ணீரில் கலந்து 2 நிமிடம் கொதிக்க வைத்தால் சத்து மாவு கூழ் தயாராகி விடும். 

3.அதில் அவரவர் விருப்பப்படி இனிப்பு அல்லது உப்பு அல்லது உப்பு, மிளகுபொடி சேர்த்து பருகலாம். 

4.எதுவும் கலக்காமல் அப்படியேகூட குடிக்கலாம்.காலையில் 2 டம்ளர் சத்துமாவு பானம் குடித்தால் காலை சாப்பாடு பூர்த்தியாகி விடும்.

5.இதன்மூலம் உடலுக்கு தேவையான சத்துகள் மற்றும் சக்தி கிடைக்கிறது. 
6.கார்போஹைட்ரேட், கொழுப்பு குறைவாக இருப்பதால் உடல் பெருக்காது. 

7.உடல் எடையை குறைக்க உதவுகிறது. குழந்தைகளுக்கு ஏற்ற உணவு. காலை, மாலை வேளைகளில் அவர்களுக்கு தரலாம். 

8.முதியோர்கள் இதை அருந்தும் போது உடனடி சக்தி கிடைப்பதை உணர முடியும். எளிதில் ஜீரணிக்க கூடிய உணவு.

குறிப்பு:

5 மாதம் கெடாது.

1.சத்து மாவு காய வைத்து, வறுத்து அரைக்கப்படுவதால் 5 மாதம் வரை கெடாது. 

2.பொதுவாக ஒரு நபர் ஒரு நாளைக்கு 50 கிராம் வரை பயன்படுத்தினால் ஒரு கிலோ பாக்கெட் 20 நாளில் தீர்ந்து விடும். இதனால், கெட்டு விடுமோ என்ற கவலையும் தேவையில்லை. 

இன்றே இதை உங்கள் வீட்டில் நீங்களே தயாரித்து உங்களின் அக்கறை மிக்க குடும்பத்தினர் அனைவரும் பயன்படுத்தி நலமும் வளமும் பெறுங்கள். 

குறிப்பு : காலையில் அவசரமாக வேலைக்கு போகிறவர்கள் கண்டிப்பாக குடியுங்கள்... 

பகிருங்கள் நம் மக்கள் உடல் பலம் அடையட்டும்....

Babies are more prone to catching different kinds of infections and diseases. 😰 They can’t fight bacteria, viruses and other infection-causing germs as easily as adults.

Common Cold is probably the most common infection that a baby catches and you can expect this to happen at least 5 times in the first year! 😫

So, here are the 25 home remedies to treat cough and cold in babies according to their age as well....😮http://bit.ly/2CaUzd6_25_Effective_Home_Remedies_To_Treat_Cold_And_Cough_in_Babies_and_Kids_3M_to_3Y

So, here are the Top 10 Bedtime Stories for toddlers according to their age...👶http://bit.ly/2CgV45z_bedtime_stories

25/02/18, 11:25 AM - Bd Reetika: Hot water is adviced after 72 hours. Initial 48-72 hours you should apply ice as swelling comes due to inflammation in nerves and ice is an agent that contract your nerves and reduce swelling

26/02/18, 9:21 AM - ‪+91 99460 02674‬: Did you know that babies who grow up in loquacious surroundings or are born in talkative families have a higher IQ by the time they are three-years-old? Such children also score better at school by the age of nine, when compared to children who grow up in relatively quiet surroundings.

The finding was published in the book ‘Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children’, by Betty Hart and Todd Risley.

Typically, a baby’s first words are something that every mom remembers fondly. But, how early is too early to begin to talk to your young one? Did you know that there are child prodigies who can speak three worded sentences by the age of eight months? And, incredibly, it’s pretty much within your limits to help your baby cultivate language skills. Here’ how you can achieve it:

1. Start Talking Very Early:
When your baby is still at the babbling stage, you don’t need to wait for him to lap up words and begin to talk. You should talk to your baby right from the start – perhaps right from birth. That way, the baby not only recognizes you, forms a deep bond with you, but also picks up the language fairly earlier than other babies. Early talking also helps babies to develop a large vocabulary. Early talking helps your baby familiarize himself with the words. And, with regular usage, your baby can gather the meaning of the word.

Eventually, your baby could make a registry of the words in his brains. The more your baby hears the words, the more he would gain coherence. In yet another study, it turned out that preterm babies who were in the neonatal intensive care unit and exposed to a decent number of words, responded with sounds of their own, indicating that conversing with a premature baby could help developing his speech.

2. Help With Connecting The Words:
If your baby has had a long day with his routine of feeding, soothing, and changing, and you think he must sleep, tell him, “It’s time for a nap, honey.” If you watch your baby looking at a certain thing, tell him what that thing is and what it does, whether it is an eatable or a utility item, or if it is an animate creature like a bird or a pet. Keep telling him about everything you do with him – right from making food to setting his crib to organizing his toys. Or simply chant rhythmic nursery rhymes.

3. Read A Story:
Even if your baby doesn’t understand a story yet, it’s quite an interesting way for him to learn words. If you are reading children’s books, they are more likely to be colorful and bright. Show your baby the images to stimulate his imagination. You could explain the pictures as you go along. There are ‘touch-and-feel’ books available for babies under six months that could be quite useful and help them explore for themselves.

4. Encourage Dialogue:
True, your baby might be too small to start talking in a meaningful way. But if your baby is already cooing at a thing, respond back. It will make your baby feel that you care for what he has to say. It could be quite encouraging. Also, he points to a cat or dog, tell him what it is, and what it is doing. If he utters meaningless sounds and you don’t know what he is trying to say, you might as well respond in positive ways by making up a story. Or simply say something out of the box.

5. Put Your Baby Away From TV And Internet:
There are loads of baby-centric programs on TV. A major chunk is also accessible on the Internet. Given that your baby has easy access to your laptop, tablet or smartphone, it’s necessary that you keep him away from these. It might be easy to think that you can get away with your work while hooking your little one on these programs, but the reality is that such programs rarely do any good. Think; an animation does not talk back to your baby. A character from TV doesn’t smile back either. And these reactions are important to raise your baby’s stimulus to get him started with talking or learning a language.  Two-way communication is important to help baby learn to talk faster.

26/02/18, 12:54 PM - ‪+91 89397 13407‬: Sathumaavu is a recent fad. It can be given. But it's not a necessity. All ingredients we add in sathumaavu, if we give in daily food there is no need for sathu maavu.
26/02/18, 12:54 PM - ‪+91 89397 13407‬: Yes u can

If any of the symptoms u notice them rush to doc. Else not required.

26/02/18, 12:59 PM - ‪+91 89397 13407‬: I have two recipes. 
1. Soak dates overnight. Blend and sieve it. Boil the liquid portion and serve baby directly or as a sweetener in porridge
2. Cook dates in a PC for three whistle and do the same as above

26/02/18, 2:25 PM - ‪+91 97380 45995‬: Don't switch to cow milk so early .. it will not do good .. its difficult to convince the old generation ..but be strong
26/02/18, 2:31 PM - ‪+91 89397 13407‬: No cow milk for babies till 1 year. Your milk is sufficient. From 6 months u ll start on solids. So Don worry. 

We adults have lot of emotions and things to express. If we are hungry we eat. If we are thirsty we drink. If we are angry we vent out. If we are stressed we relax if we are Ill we do things to get healthy. But a baby can't express anything. So whatever may be the need - food, thirst, comfort, anger, love, sickness baby will only cry suckle feed. When they suckle they may or may not take feed based on their need. They are looking for comfort. Which u as a mother will provide by hugging kissing cuddling and breastfeeding. Whoever sees it will interpret baby's cry as insufficient feed. So u ignore that. And elders will say not to hold baby always and leave on bed or floor. Don listen to that. Cuddle baby as much as u cud. For me everyone said she ll demand to be carried always. But now my baby is 9 months she hardly let me hold her and keeps playing
26/02/18, 2:32 PM - ‪+91 96770 30681‬: Yup rigjt

27/02/18, 12:10 PM - ‪+91 99460 02674‬: A happy chubby baby is an obsession for all mothers. We all have constantly been fed on the idea that chubby babies are not just cute, they are healthy too. This idea is embedded in our minds by poems, TV advertisements and the likes.

If you are worried that your baby is thin, despite all the efforts you put up to make him/her eat nutritious foods, don’t fret! There might be relatives and friends taunting if you are not giving proper food to your baby because they resemble the malnourished ones of the other world. Just relax and maintain your cool, because chubby babies are more likely to be obese and slower in their motor skill development as compared to thin babies.

Studies point out that children who are heavier than their peers at 24 months are likely to become obese when they reach adolescence. You are the lucky mother of a healthy baby if you do not have to rush to the doctor often, if your baby has completed all milestones and if your baby is pleasant and happy. Let your baby remain thin! Thin is healthy.

Check The Activities:
There are lots of activities the kids normally engage in. More activities mean more calories to be burnt naturally resulting in a thin baby but a healthy one.

Stop being paranoid about all the excessive activities and constant running around that your baby engages in. It is only through active learning that kids grow up. Their fine motor skills and gross motor skills have to be developed. If a child is very active and continuously runs from this corner to that, be it at home or in the garden, it is very likely that he/she hardly gets time to complete the meal. Their ‘play time’ preoccupies their mind. Such babies have frequent meals because they feel hungry often. But each meal is left incomplete which is the reason why they have to rush for frequent meals. You may sit with your baby and ask him/ her to complete the meal. This way, the digestion process would also be maintained because we need to give the gut some rest!

Premature Babies Likely To Be More Obese:
According to the Journal of Neuro Science Research, experiments were conducted on rats as rats have a great similarity to human babies. Initially, the food given to rats was controlled so that they produced pre-term babies, which are lower in weight than their peers. The rodent babies thus born were put under observation and it was found that they eat more because the neuropeptides disrupted in function.

Neuropeptides are protein-like molecules, which help the signaling activity in the brain. The disrupted function of the neuropeptides in pre-term rats resulted in the intake of larger calories with less amount of energy expenditure. The same case applies to human babies as well. So, if your baby is premature, always check with a pediatrician on how to balance the diet. That is, do not be happy when your baby suddenly starts fattening up and gets the chubby guise that you have always dreamt of.
Don’t Feed Your Baby To Being Unhealthy:
A popular study suggests that in an experiment conducted with rats, it was found that those rats whose diet was controlled and systematic became healthy as they grew up rather than those rats that were fed excessively. The rats that were fed excessively were diagnosed with higher levels of cholesterol and became obese as adults.

Try not to over-feed your babies if you find them thin and do not load them with high-protein, high-fat diet that they might find very difficult to digest. Avoid sugary cereals and all those junk foods that promote the concept of a healthy obese baby. Remember chubby is not always healthy!

So, just keep a record of your baby’s activities and food habits. Note down the times when you visit the neonatologist and also keep a track record of the baby’s vaccinations. Your baby might be thin, but he/ she is HEALTHY

27/02/18, 12:35 PM - Moms Event Sonakshi: Hi Mommies,
As babies suffer from cold and cough, you directly go for the allopathy medicines. Medicines do give positive results very soon but they do have many side effects also.

So, it's always better to opt for home remedies rather than seeking allopathic medicines for kids.

So it remain as it is and comes out through fecal mater. Nothing to worry.

1.Things u need are 100 ml of castor oil, 4 minute sugar granule sized camphor pieces, silver lamp, brass plate
2.place a paper on a level platform and build the set up.
take a clean wick (the one that i used is made from pure cotton made at home) and put it in a silver lamp filled with castor oil.
3.take support  and put a small brass plate on the lamp.
Light the lamp and see that the soot is being collected in the brass plate. the extra soot gets collected on to the paper placed below

4.once the soot is collected, scrap and collect it into a silver container easy enough to mix

5.take a toothpick and blend into the soot few drops of ghee and camphor and shift the containers into a closed silver container

02/03/18, 9:46 PM - ‪+91 98403 81714‬: My house is  'My HOME' not a hotel Room

Dirty dishes prove I feed my family.  A full trash can mean I clean up after them.

Messy floors mean I let my child have fun.

A pile of unfolded laundry means I keep my family in clean cloths.

A wet bathroom means my kid took  a shower.

So when you walk into my house and see a 'mess' think twice before you judge.

If you come over to see us,  come on in....
If you are coming over to see my house please make an appointment.

just to make you point that 

I am a human being not a robot to run behind every act of the family members and reset all mess immediately.

- I am a WIfe 
- I am a mother 
- I am a friend
- I am a daughter and  a sister
There are no. of other activities other than housekeeping.

Last but not the least " I HAVE MY OWN MOOD"

05/03/18, 5:55 PM - ‪+91 96561 21021‬: Breast milk may taste different in one breast, if it has a lower supply than the other. Maybe your baby is refusing one breast because he/she is just more comfortable on one side. Try to Lie down n feed. Try n offering the least desired breast first with every feeding or before offering left side extract little milk initially it's little watery.

Hi Mommies,
Babies are more prone to catching different kinds of infections and diseases. 😰 They can’t fight bacteria, viruses and other infection-causing germs as easily as adults.

Common Cold is probably the most common infection that a baby catches and you can expect this to happen at least 5 times in the first year! 😫

So, here are the 25 home remedies to treat cough and cold in babies according to their age as well....😮http://bit.ly/2CaUzd6_25_Effective_Home_Remedies_To_Treat_Cold_And_Cough_in_Babies_and_Kids_3M_to_3Y
07/03/18, 8:09 PM - Bd Reetika: Hi Mommies,
As babies suffer from cold and cough, you directly go for the allopathy medicines. Medicines do give positive results very soon but they do have many side effects also.

So, it's always better to opt for home remedies rather than seeking allopathic medicines for kids.

To make it easy for you, we have listed the best and effective home remedies and also acupressure points to relieve a runny nose in babies 🤗
